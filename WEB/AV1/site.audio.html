			<p><a name="loseyourself">Lose Yourself</a></p>
				
				<p>Look<br>
					If you had one shot or one opportunity<br>
					To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment<br>
					Would you capture it<br>
					Or just let it slip? Yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
					There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
					He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br>
					To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'<br>
					What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
					He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
					He's chokin' how everybody's jokin' now<br>
					The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow<br>
					Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity, ope<br>
					There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't<br>
					Give up that easy, no, he won't have it<br>
					He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope<br>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>You better</p>

				<p>
					His soul's escapin' through this hole that is gapin'<br>
					This world is mine for the takin', make me king<br>
					As we move toward a new world order<br>
					A normal life is borin', but superstardom's<br>
					Close to postmortem, it only grows harder<br>
					Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over<br>
					These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows<br>
					He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads<br>
					God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
					He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
					But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water<br>
					These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product<br>
					They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br>
					He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br>
					Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner<br>
					But the beat goes on<br>
					Da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>You better</p>

				<p>
					No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>
					Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br>
					I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed<br>
					I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
					But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
					Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>
					All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
					Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-five<br>
					And I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br>
					'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br>
					And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br>
					And these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder<br>
					Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter<br>
					Caught up between being a father and a prima donna<br>
					Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna<br>
					Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's<br>
					Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got<br>
					To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br>
					Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not<br>
					Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go<br>
					I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>
					So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not<br>
					This may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>
					(You better lose) yourself in the music<br>
					The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)<br>
					You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
					This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
				</p>

				<p>You better</p>

			<p><i>Letra (Lyrics)</i></p>

			<p>
				May I have your attention, please?<br>
				May I have your attention, please?<br>
				Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br>
				I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br>
				We're gonna have a problem here<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Y'all act like you never seen a white person before<br>
				Jaws all on the floor, like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door<br>
				And started whoopin' her ass worse than before<br>
				They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh!)<br>
				It's the return of the: Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding<br>
				He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?<br>
				And Dr. Dre said: Nothing, you idiots!<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)<br>
				Feminist women love Eminem<br>
				Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him<br>
				Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what<br>
				Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though<br>
				Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose<br>
				But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms<br>
				Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose<br>
				But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose<br>
				My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips<br>
				And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss<br>
				And that's the message that we deliver to little kids<br>
				And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is<br>
				Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is<br>
				By the time they hit fourth grade<br>
				They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				We ain't nothin' but mammals<br>
				Well, some of us, cannibals<br>
				Who cut other people open like cantaloupes<br>
				But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes<br>
				Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope<br>
				But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote<br>
				Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
				All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating<br>
				So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up<br>
				Please stand up, please stand up?<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
				All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating<br>
				So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up<br>
				Please stand up, please stand up?<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records<br>
				Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!<br>
				You think I give a damn about a Grammy?<br>
				Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me<br>
				But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?<br>
				Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?<br>
				So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
				Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs<br>
				So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst<br>
				And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first<br>
				Little bitch put me on blast on MTV<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee<br>
				I should download her audio on MP3<br>
				And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (agh!)<br>
				I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups<br>
				All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you<br>
				And there's a million of us just like me<br>
				Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me<br>
				Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me<br>
				And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
				All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating<br>
				So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up<br>
				Please stand up, please stand up?<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady<br>
				All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating<br>

			<p><i>Letra (Lyrics)</i></p>

			<p>
				I'm not afraid to take a stand<br>
				Everybody come take my hand<br>
				We'll walk this road together, through the storm<br>
				Whatever weather, cold or warm<br>
				Just let me know that you're not alone<br>
				Holla, if you feel that you've been down the same road<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Yeah, it's been a ride<br>
				I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one<br>
				Now some of you might still be in that place<br>
				If you're trying to get out, just follow me<br>
				I'll get you there<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em<br>
				But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em<br>
				'Cause ain't no way I'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem<br>
				When I say I'mma do something I do it, I don't give a damn<br>
				What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world<br>
				Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me<br>
				I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably<br>
				And all those who look down on me, I'm tearing down your balcony<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				No if, ands, or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he<br>
				From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shitting<br>
				Whether he's on salary, paid hourly<br>
				Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him<br>
				Whichever comes first, for better or worse<br>
				He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas<br>
				His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge<br>
				To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe<br>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I'm not afraid to take a stand<br>
				Everybody come take my hand<br>
				We'll walk this road together, through the storm<br>
				Whatever weather, cold or warm<br>
				Just let me know that, you're not alone<br>
				Holla, if you feel like you've been down the same road<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Ok, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap<br>
				I shouldn't have to rhyme these words<br>
				In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap<br>
				You said you was king, you lied through your teeth<br>
				For that fuck your feelings<br>
				Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped<br>
				And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back<br>
				I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact<br>
				Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehh<br>
				Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Relax, I ain't going back to that now<br>
				All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack<br>
				'Cause I ain't playin' around<br>
				There's a game called circle and I don't know how<br>
				I'm way too up to back down<br>
				But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out<br>
				Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't<br>
				This fucking black cloud still follows me around<br>
				But it's time to exorcise these demons<br>
				These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm not afraid to take a stand<br>
				Everybody come take my hand<br>
				We'll walk this road together, through the storm<br>
				Whatever weather, cold or warm<br>
				Just let me know that, you're not alone<br>
				Holla, if you feel that you've been down the same road<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				And I just can't keep living this way<br>
				So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage<br>
				I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons<br>
				I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground<br>
				I've had enough, now I'm so fed up<br>
				Time to put my life back together right now<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me<br>
				Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you<br>
				So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through<br>
				And don't even realize what you did, believe me you<br>
				I been through the wringer, but they can do little to the middle finger<br>
				I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead<br>
				No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on, I promise<br>
				To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father<br>
				So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof<br>
				Like my daughters and raise it<br>
				You couldn't lift a single shingle on it<br>
				'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club<br>
				Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up<br>
				'Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the Moon<br>
				But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm not afraid to take a stand<br>
				Everybody come take my hand<br>
				We'll walk this road together, through the storm<br>
				Whatever weather, cold or warm<br>
				Just let me know that, you're not alone<br>
				Holla, if you feel that you've been down the same road<br>

			<p>
				Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
				Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
				Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
				Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
				I love the way you lie<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				I can't tell you what it really is<br>
				I can only tell you what it feels like<br>
				And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe<br>
				I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight<br>
				As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight<br>
				High off of love, drunk from her hate<br>
				It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, the more I suffer<br>
				I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown<br>
				She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
				And I love it, "Wait<br>
				Where you going?" "I'm leaving you"<br>
				"No you ain't, come back"<br>
				We're running right back, here we go again<br>
				It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great<br>
				I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane<br>
				But when it's bad, it's awful
				I feel so ashamed, I snapped, "Who's that dude?"<br>
				I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her<br>
				I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
				Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
				Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
				Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
				I love the way you lie<br>
				I love the way you lie<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?<br>
				You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em<br>
				Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em<br>
				Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em<br>
				You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em<br>
				Now you're in each other's face<br>
				Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em<br>
				You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em<br>
				Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em<br>
				It's the rage that took over, it controls you both<br>
				So they say you're best to go your separate ways<br>
				Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday<br>
				Yesterday is over, it's a different day<br>
				Sound like broken records playin' over<br>
				But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint<br>
				You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game<br>
				But you lied again<br>
				Now you get to watch her leave out the window<br>
				Guess that's why they call it window pane<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
				Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
				Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
				Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
				I love the way you lie<br>
				I love the way you lie<br>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean<br>
				Then we fall back into the same patterns<br>
				Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is<br>
				You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded<br>
				Baby, please come back, it wasn't you<br>
				Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems<br>
				Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano<br>
				All I know is I love you too much to walk away though<br>
				Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk<br>
				Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?<br>
				Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball<br>
				Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall<br>
				Next time? There won't be no next time<br>
				I apologize, even though I know it's lies<br>
				I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar<br>
				If she ever tries to fucking leave again<br>
				I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
				Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
				Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>

				[Lil' Wayne]<br>
				Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower<br>
				But it's fuck the world, get a child out her<br>
				Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her<br>
				Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers<br>
				I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour<br>
				Married to the game, but she broke her vows<br>
				That's why my bars are full of broken bottlesv
				And my night stands are full of open Bibles<br>
				I think about more than I forget<br>
				But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat<br>
				And these niggas know I lay them down, make their bed<br>
				Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg<br>
				Money outweighing problems on the triple beam<br>
				I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes<br>
				Huh, be good or be good at it<br>
				Fucking right, I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic<br>
				Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say<br>
				I'm high as a bitch: Up, up and away<br>
				Man, I come down in a couple of days<br>
				Okay, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode<br>
				I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code<br>
				It's Weezy, motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode<br>
				All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole<br>
				So you can keep knocking, but won't knock me down<br>
				No love lost, no love found<br>

			<p>
				[Eminem & Lil' Wayne]<br>
				It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now<br>
				You kicked me when I was down<br>
				Fuck what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more)<br>
				That's right, bitch, and I don't need you, don't want to see you<br>
				Bitch, you get (no love)<br>
				You show me nothing but hate<br>
				You ran me into the ground<br>
				But what comes around goes around<br>
				I don't need you (don't hurt me)<br>
				You (don't hurt me no more)<br>
				That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you<br>
				You get (no love, no love, no love, no love)<br>
				Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love, no love)<br>
				And I don't need you<br>
				Get 'em<br>

				I'm alive again<br>
				More alive than I have been in my whole entire life<br>
				I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin<br>
				To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most<br>
				Shit's finna get thick again<br>
				They say the competition is stiff<br>
				But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in<br>
				I ain't never giving in again<br>
				Cuss into the wind, complete freedom<br>
				Look at these rappers, how I treat them<br>
				So why the fuck would I join them when I beat them<br>
				They call me a freak because<br>
				I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them<br>
				Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage<br>
				Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?<br>
				Snatch the mic from him, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute<br>
				Yeah, the rap is tight<br>
				But I'm fucking with the greatest verse of all time<br>
				So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um<br>
				Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit<br>
				And start over from scratch and write new ones<br>
				But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference<br>
				When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight<br>
				It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump<br>
				In the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow<br>
				Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd<br>
				You can see the sparks from hot metal<br>
				Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game<br>
				I so started to rock fellow<br>
				When I'm not even in my harshest<br>
				You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow<br>
				Till I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop<br>
				I'm standing on my Monopoly board<br>
				That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop<br>
				Till my hip don't hop anymore<br>
				When you so good that you can't say it<br>
				Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore<br>
				People just get sick 'cause you spit<br>
				These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore<br>
				And you can never break my stride<br>
				You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow<br>
				You'll never take my pride<br>
				Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent
				Is getting no mercy, mark my words<br>
				Ain't letting up, relentless<br>
				I smell blood, I don't give a fuck: Keep giving them hell<br>
				Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
				You get no love<br>
			</p>

				[Eminem & Lil' Wayne]<br>
				It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now<br>
				You kicked me when I was down<br>
				Fuck what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more)<br>
				That's right bitch: And I don't need you, don't want to see you<br>
				Bitch you get (no love)<br>
				You show me nothing but hate<br>
				You ran me into the ground<br>
				But what comes around goes around<br>
				I don't need you (don't hurt me)<br>
				You (don't hurt me no more)<br>
				That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you<br>
				You get (no love, no love, no love, no love)<br>
				Bitch, you get (no love, no love, no love, no love)<br>
				And I don't need you<br>
				Bitch, you get no love<br>
